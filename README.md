## Version management

`foxy-changelog` is providing support to automatically generate the version of your python project according their commit history.

The management is based on [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) and [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

As defined in the conventional commit specification:

>- The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
>- The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.

`foxy-changelog` is providing two entry points for `setuptools_scm.version_scheme` configuration.

### semver-conventional-commit-foxy

Based on [semver](https://semver.org/lang/fr/).

Rules:

- A commit with type `feat` activates an increment of the minor.
- All other types will activate an increment of the patch.

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking changes is not supported yet.

### calendar-conventional-commit-foxy

To manage version based on the calendar. The supported convention is YYYY.MM.Patch with Patch a number not 0-padded starting to 1. (example: 2024.01.1).

Rules:

- A commit with type `feat` activates an increment of the month.
- All other types will activate an increment of the patch version.
- The year is automatically incremented at the end a year.

### Hatch

[Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) is supporting out of the box thanks to [hatch-vcs](https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs).
Python projet using other project management tool can use `setuptools_scm` directly.

Ensure `hatch-vcs` and `foxy-changelog` is defined within the `build-system.requires` field in your `pyproject.toml` file.

All other options supported by `hatch-vcs` and `setuptools_scm` can be used. More information can be found in their documentation.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling", "hatch-vcs", "foxy-changelog"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.version]
source = "vcs"

[tool.hatch.version.raw-options]
version_scheme = "semver-conventional-commit-foxy"
```
